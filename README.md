## **MATCHING GAME RULES**
----
* Open the cards to find matches.
* Matched cards stay open, unmatched cards flip closed.
* You have 60 seconds to match all the cards!
* Buttons _Play_ and _Restart_ are used to start and restart the game.
* Game progress is calculated based on the amount of time and moves used to match all the cards:
* Be thoughtful! In order to get a higher star rating match all the cards with the minimum number of moves possible.
    - If you manage to match all the cards before the time runs out:
        - A screen appears showing your star rating, # of moves and the time used to match all the cards.
    -  If you fail to match all the cards within 60 seconds:
        - Game over screen appears.

### **FEATURES**
----
* Session timer is showing the time left until the game stops.
* Stars counter displays a rotating star indicating the current score.
* Moves counter displays current number of moves.

#### **NOTE**
----
* Game doesn't start until _Play_ button is pushed.
* Be cautious: _Timer_ starts with the _Play_ button, NOT with the first card flip.
* To stop the game use _Restart_ button. CAUTION: if you hit _Restart_ button current progress will be lost.
